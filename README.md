# Character conversations

This tool serves the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in crafting non-playable characters (NPCs) for role-playing games (RPGs) and engaging in dialogues with them.

The primary objective of this tool is to refine the fine-tuning process of an LLM, enabling it to function as a video game character capable of interacting with players and making decisions based on the ongoing conversation.
